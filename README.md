**Notes/Questions:**  

* For the protocol = [ http, https, peer ], shouldn't it be protocol = < http, https, peer >, since the protocol element is a required element?


* Peer Protocol section:

  * In the Network Time Protocol (NTP) [sntp] protocol, we only show NTP servers that are suitable for the US. Should we provide any international servers to that list?
  
  * In the [ips] section of the peer protocol section, is says that "A port **may must** be specified after adding a space to the address". Which one is correct? From the examples (example one specifically), it looks like the correct statement is **may**, but I wanted to check to make sure.  
Examples:  
192.168.0.1  
192.168.0.1 3939  
r.ripple.com 51235



* Database section

  * In the DB section, NuDB and RocksDB are described and from the file, it makes it seem like these are the only DBs you can set up with a Ripple server. 
  Are these enterprise-ready DBs or meant for testing purposes? 
  Can a server admin connect a different database such as Oracle or Postgres or Mongodb to Ripple?
